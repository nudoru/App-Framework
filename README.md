# NORI App Framework

Nori is a handy starting template for my JS projects based on some ideas from: Redux, Flux, Model-View-Intent, React, Mithril and other interesting ideas. I created it to help me learn to be a JavaScript Ninja by implementing features that I like rather than using someone else's implementation or framework.

Dependencies:
- RxJS
- GreenSock Animation Platform
- Lodash
- Nudoru utility classes

I need to rewrite docs but take a look at the overview PDF
